# Lessons (appended after user corrections)

## 2026-09-18 — Don't propose a control that already exists as a step
Pattern: proposed a "requires new data, yes/no" flag for idea proposals; the operator pointed out E-054's
data-availability gate already does this, per variant, pre-backtest.
Rule: before proposing any new check/flag/score, grep the stage graph (STAGE_CONFIGS, USER_GUIDE §2.1)
and the existing gates; if a step already owns the concern, route to it instead of adding a sibling.

## 2026-09-18 — Component-gap detection belongs where words become config
Pattern: put the "requires new component" outlet at hypothesis design (Step 1); the operator corrected
that feasibility is checked at backtest_specification, where the design is turned into a bot config.
Rule: place a check at the earliest step that has the concrete information the check needs, not the
earliest step conceptually related to it.

## 2026-09-17 — Write for a new joiner
Pattern: first review reply was dense and jargon-heavy; the operator asked for the same content in plain
words.
Rule: default to plain language, short sentences, one idea per sentence; keep file paths and line refs
in the record file, not in the prose the operator reads.
